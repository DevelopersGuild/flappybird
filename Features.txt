GROUND
Ground image that moves across screen at the same speed as the pipes (Pipes class)

BALANCE
Decide the speed of things in the game, the strength of the jump, and more.  Modify the game as required to be fun, fair, and balanced.  
Probably make the jumps more powerful, the bird fall faster, and the bird be further left on-screen so that you can see further ahead.

FORWARD JUMP INDICATOR SHOULD BOB UP AND DOWN
Every ten jumps up, you can jump forward be pressing right arrow key.  
In the lower-right hand corner, there is a grey arrow that turns green to represent this, but it's not very visible when playing the game.  
Make it bob up and down when it's green to show that it's available.  (Use the mathematical sine function, sin().)
