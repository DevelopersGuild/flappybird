TITLE ON START SCREEN
Write the text "FLAPPY BIRD" in big letters across the top of the start screen.

GROUND
Ground image that moves across screen at the same speed as the pipes. (Pipes class)

MODIFY FORWARD JUMP
Right now, every ten jumps, you can jump foward by pressing RIGHT ARROW KEY.
This is hard to use in the current incarnation of the game because the game is
so fast.  Modify forward jump to do something more useful.
Example: Slow time to half speed for a few seconds.

POWERUPS
Invent and then add a powerup.  You will need a graphic: draw one or find one
on the web.  Talk to an officer and make a plan on what code will need to be
written.
Example: Shrink pipes for a few seconds.
Example: Make the bird invincible for a few seconds.

FORK THE PROJECT
If you want to continue to develop or play with Flappy Bird on your own, you
can fork it on Github and have your own version!
